Resentment is the feeling of frustration, judgment, anger, “better than,” and/or hidden envy related to perceived unfairness or injustice. It’s an emotion that we often experience when we fail to set boundaries or ask for what we need, or when expectations let us down because they were based on things we can’t control, like what other people think, what they feel, or how they’re going to react.

Now, before weekends, vacations, or even busy school or workweeks, we talk about expectations. We specifically ask each other, “What do you want this weekend to look like?” I might say, “This is going to be a busy weekend. I’m down for whatever we need to do, but I would like to swim at least one day and play pickleball for a couple of hours on Saturday.” Steve might say, “Let’s try to grab dinner, just the two of us, on Saturday night after we drop off Charlie. I’d like to play water polo for a couple of hours on Sunday. What time is pickleball?” That doesn’t mean stealth expectations no longer trip us up. They do. But now we help each other. We help each other reality-check our expectations, we ask each other a lot of questions about what we think will happen or what we want to happen, and we often ask ourselves and each other: What’s this about? What are you not saying?

Working memory becomes overloaded if it has to process too much information at the same time. This typically happens when you don’t have sufficient knowledge of the prerequisites.

A far superior strategy is to firstly identify the underlying sub-skills (arithmetic, algebra) that you may be lacking and master these first.

You can use pre-training to approach any study material. Firstly, identify the key concepts and vocabulary. Secondly, use the internet or any other resource to find simple definitions. Thirdly, begin to explore how the concepts relate to one another.

To achieve this, you need to minimize the level of extrinsic load and optimize the level of intrinsic load (i.e. find the right level of difficulty).

Let’s recap what we’ve learned! Your working memory is the workbench of your mind. It keeps track of what you’re seeing, hearing, thinking and imagining while allowing you to work with that to produce long-term memories and solutions. The most popular scientific model has four components of which we reviewed the most well-studied three: Phonological Loop. Keeps track of what you’ve just heard. Also used to subvocalize thoughts, while reading, speaking or thinking. Visuospatial Sketchpad. Keeps track of pictures and spatial information. Central Executive. Allocates attention and manipulates information, just like a carpenter on the workbench. The most important finding about working memories is that they are limited. The average person can only hold 4-7 pieces of information at a time. The flip-side of this is that we can chunk information. By combining complex information into recognizable chunks, even super complicated things can fit onto your mental workbench. To make best use of your working memory: Avoid music and distracting sounds while doing mentally demanding work and studying. Emphasize the most important information by speaking it aloud. Use visual mnemonics to keep track of more ideas at once. Visualization can improve studying over merely summarizing for some subjects. Try to apply your imagination more when you study. If you struggle with a problem, break it into simpler parts. Mastery comes from chunking–building up stored patterns so complex things become simple. In addition to the components of working memory, we talked about three other issues. Chunking, cognitive load and anxiety. Cognitive load determines a lot of what makes something confusing or difficult. (Attention and specific learning disabilities, can also be factors, however.) In particular there are three types of cognitive loads: Intrinsic load. The difficulty of the idea itself. Extrinsic load. Difficulties due to poor presentation/instruction. Germane load. The effort required to make new chunks and remember. You can mitigate intrinsic load by pre-training. Breaking down a complex subject into simple parts, which you master first before moving on. You can ease extrinsic load by finding good resources for learning, or reorganizing confusing ones. Finally anxiety has a big impact on working memory. By crowding out the information you need to process, distracting thoughts can make it very hard to perform. Try reframing your anxiety as excitement, seeking confident instructors and journaling your thoughts to make it easier.
