Resentment is the feeling of frustration, judgment, anger, “better than,” and/or hidden envy related to perceived unfairness or injustice. It’s an emotion that we often experience when we fail to set boundaries or ask for what we need, or when expectations let us down because they were based on things we can’t control, like what other people think, what they feel, or how they’re going to react.

Now, before weekends, vacations, or even busy school or workweeks, we talk about expectations. We specifically ask each other, “What do you want this weekend to look like?” I might say, “This is going to be a busy weekend. I’m down for whatever we need to do, but I would like to swim at least one day and play pickleball for a couple of hours on Saturday.” Steve might say, “Let’s try to grab dinner, just the two of us, on Saturday night after we drop off Charlie. I’d like to play water polo for a couple of hours on Sunday. What time is pickleball?” That doesn’t mean stealth expectations no longer trip us up. They do. But now we help each other. We help each other reality-check our expectations, we ask each other a lot of questions about what we think will happen or what we want to happen, and we often ask ourselves and each other: What’s this about? What are you not saying?

Let’s recap what we’ve learned! Your working memory is the workbench of your mind. It keeps track of what you’re seeing, hearing, thinking and imagining while allowing you to work with that to produce long-term memories and solutions. The most popular scientific model has four components of which we reviewed the most well-studied three: Phonological Loop. Keeps track of what you’ve just heard. Also used to subvocalize thoughts, while reading, speaking or thinking. Visuospatial Sketchpad. Keeps track of pictures and spatial information. Central Executive. Allocates attention and manipulates information, just like a carpenter on the workbench. The most important finding about working memories is that they are limited. The average person can only hold 4-7 pieces of information at a time. The flip-side of this is that we can chunk information. By combining complex information into recognizable chunks, even super complicated things can fit onto your mental workbench. To make best use of your working memory: Avoid music and distracting sounds while doing mentally demanding work and studying. Emphasize the most important information by speaking it aloud. Use visual mnemonics to keep track of more ideas at once. Visualization can improve studying over merely summarizing for some subjects. Try to apply your imagination more when you study. If you struggle with a problem, break it into simpler parts. Mastery comes from chunking–building up stored patterns so complex things become simple. In addition to the components of working memory, we talked about three other issues. Chunking, cognitive load and anxiety. Cognitive load determines a lot of what makes something confusing or difficult. (Attention and specific learning disabilities, can also be factors, however.) In particular there are three types of cognitive loads: Intrinsic load. The difficulty of the idea itself. Extrinsic load. Difficulties due to poor presentation/instruction. Germane load. The effort required to make new chunks and remember. You can mitigate intrinsic load by pre-training. Breaking down a complex subject into simple parts, which you master first before moving on. You can ease extrinsic load by finding good resources for learning, or reorganizing confusing ones. Finally anxiety has a big impact on working memory. By crowding out the information you need to process, distracting thoughts can make it very hard to perform. Try reframing your anxiety as excitement, seeking confident instructors and journaling your thoughts to make it easier.

If I do not feel lovable, it is very difficult to believe that anyone else loves me. If I do not accept myself, how can I accept your love for me? Your warmth and devotion are confusing: it confounds my self-concept, since I “know” I am not lovable. Your feeling for me cannot possibly be real, reliable, or lasting. If I do not feel lovable, your love for me becomes an effort to fill a sieve, and eventually the effort is likely to exhaust you.

First, ultralearning is a strategy. A strategy is not the only solution to a given problem, but it may be a good one. Strategies also tend to be well suited for certain situations and not others, so using them is a choice, not a commandment.

If one of my goals is to have a successful and satisfying marriage, what is the present state of my marriage? Do I know? Would my partner and I answer the same way? Are my partner and I happy with each other? Are there frustrations and unresolved issues? If so, what am I doing about them? Do I have an action plan, or am I merely hoping that “somehow” things will improve? If one of my aspirations is one day to have my own business, what am I doing about it? Am I closer to that goal than I was a month ago or a year ago? Am I on track or off?

Do I know what I am feeling at any particular moment? Do I recognize the impulses from which my actions spring? Do I notice if my feelings and actions are congruent? Do I know what needs or desires I may be trying to satisfy? Do I know what I actually want in a particular encounter with another person (not what I think I “should” want)? Do I know what my life is about? Is the “program” I am living one I accepted uncritically from others, or is it genuinely of my own choosing? Do I know what I am doing when I particularly like myself and what I am doing when I don’t? These are the kind of questions that intelligent self-examination entails.   Do I know what I am doing when I particularly like myself and what I am doing when I don’t?

In our relationships, creative lives, personal development and work, we can promote this advancement in two ways: expanding our ‘breadth’ (what we do – the skills we acquire, the topics we talk about, the avenues we explore) as well as our ‘depth’ (how well we do what we do – the quality of our listening, our level of engagement with the world).

when we shut parts of ourselves off, they re-emerge as pathologies and anxieties, or reasons for therapy. We are owned by feelings of depression, loneliness or anger because we are not living out – and most likely cannot even identify – our real stories.

Socratic questioning generally follows this process: Clarifying your thinking and explaining the origins of your ideas. (Why do I think this? What exactly do I think?) Challenging assumptions. (How do I know this is true? What if I thought the opposite?) Looking for evidence. (How can I back this up? What are the sources?) Considering alternative perspectives. (What might others think? How do I know I am correct?) Examining consequences and implications. (What if I am wrong? What are the consequences if I am?) Questioning the original questions. (Why did I think that? Was I correct? What conclusions can I draw from the reasoning process?)
